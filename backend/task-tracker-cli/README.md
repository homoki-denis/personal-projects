Project code explanation

1. #!/usr/bin/env node

This line is known as a "shebang" or "hashbang" and is specific to Unix and Unix-like systems (including Linux and macOS).

Here's what it means:

#! - These are the first two characters and indicate to the operating system that this file is an executable script.

/usr/bin/env node - This part specifies the interpreter that should execute the script.

/usr/bin/env is a command that locates and executes other programs.

node is the program that /usr/bin/env will look for and execute.

The purpose of this line is to allow the script to be executed directly from the command line, without needing to explicitly specify the Node.js interpreter.
For example, if the task-cli.js file has execution permissions, you can run it directly in the terminal like this:

$ ./task-cli.js

Instead of:

$ node task-cli.js

This line is especially useful for creating CLI (Command Line Interface) utilities with Node.js, allowing users to run the script like any other command in the terminal.

chmod +x task-cli.js - we make sure to add permisions for the file to be executable

npm link - this command is used to create a global link to the package, allowing you to use the package's command line interface (CLI) from anywhere in the system.

npm install -g . - this command installs the package in the global context, allowing you to use the CLI from anywhere in the system.
